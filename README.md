# Library-System-Java
Here, I am implementing a program that simulates a simple library book sharing system. Typically, you can borrow (check out) books from the
library and return them within a specified time frame. The library keeps track of all available books, making a note of the books are
are currently checked out and the books that are currently available.
A library user can search a library catalog by author or title or both and see which books are currently available.
