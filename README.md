# Library-System-Java
Here, I am implementing a program that simulates a simple library book sharing system. Users can borrow (check out) books from the
library and return them in a time frame. The library keeps track of all available books and marks books that are
are currently checked out.
The user will be able to search a library catalog by author or title or both to see which books are currently available.
